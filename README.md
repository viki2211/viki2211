- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Satviki Sharma
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently pursuing my B.tech in computer science with specialization in data science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning open-source coding
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: my life = eat, sleep, code, repeat. 

Iâ€™m a huge believer in the open-source community and Iâ€™m excited to contribute to it. Iâ€™m looking to learn about new coding languages and concepts. 
Itâ€™s going to be a lot of work, but Iâ€™m excited to see what I can accomplish in this new chapter of my life!
